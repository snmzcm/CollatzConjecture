# Collatz Conjecture Calculator 

This Python script calculates famous 3x+1 Problem and outputs "hailstone numbers".
It is also named **"3n + 1 conjecture**, the **Ulam conjecture** (after Stanisław Ulam), **Kakutani's problem** (after Shizuo Kakutani), the **Thwaites conjecture** (after Sir Bryan Thwaites), **Hasse's algorithm** (after Helmut Hasse), or the **Syracuse problem**."(Wikipedia contributors, 2021b).

In case you are not satisfied with this basic explanation, here you can read detailed version

"The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns sequences defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1. "(Wikipedia contributors, 2021b)

The sequence of numbers involved is sometimes referred to as the **hailstone sequence** or **hailstone numbers** (because the values are usually subject to multiple descents and ascents like hailstones in a cloud), or as **wondrous numbers**.(Wikipedia contributors, 2021b)
